# ODBAPI
Open-PaaS-DataBase API (ODBAPI) is a streamlined and a unified REST-based API. This API enables to execute CRUD operations on relational and NoSQL data stores. The highlights of ODBAPI are twofold: (i) decoupling cloud applications from data stores in order to facilitate the migration process, and (ii) easing the developers task by lightening the burden of managing different APIs. ODBAPI will manage the different resources of our generic resources model. This latter represents the different components that we target with our API.
